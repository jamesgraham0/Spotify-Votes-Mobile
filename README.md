âœ… Good to go
ðŸŸ¡ Needs testing with other devices, works locally
ðŸ›‘ Not working / Working on it

**FUNCTIONALITY**
- âœ… Create room (updates state of list of joinable rooms) -> emit to everyone 
- âœ… Delete room (updates state of list of joinable rooms) -> emit to everyone
- âœ… Adding the first track to queue sets it to currentlyPlaying -> emit to everyone in room 
- âœ… Adding track to queue -> emit to everyone in room
- âœ… Autoplay next track in queue
- âœ… Pop queue when track finishes
- âœ… Sort queue by votes
- âœ… Queue can only be added to once mounted. Should be able to add right away
- âœ… Add votes to every track
- âœ… Display number of users in each room both in the list of joinable rooms, and in room
- âœ… List of user names in a room once in the room
- ðŸ›‘ Only allow room host to play and pause music
- ðŸ›‘ Limit a user's votes to a track to 1
- ðŸ›‘ Kick users from room when host leaves and stop any timers, will have to add a 'playing': true || false attribute to every rm
- ðŸ›‘ room to stop the timer when a room is deleted

**Stylistic**
- âœ… Maintain the green colour of the #votes to let the user know which tracks they've voted for
- âœ… When a track is added to the queue, show a small popup over the queue tab indicating that the track has been added.
- âœ… Flash green on the 'users' icon in the room when someone joins (Animation's lookin gooooood :) )
- âœ… Progress bar for track (was removed in commit 28)
- ðŸ›‘ When the next track is popped from the queue, slide it to the left and fade it away
- ðŸ›‘ Add small photo on the queue card of who chose the track (or name)

**OTHER**
- ðŸŸ¡ Refactor and organize client-side code into one folder (a little messy right now)
