**Running the code**
* Make sure you have Node.js installed
* Make sure you have the expo app installed on your phone
* Make sure you have the Spotify app installed on your phone
* Clone the repository


* In the root directory (*Spotify-Votes-Mobile*), run `npm install`
* Run `npx expo start` to start the client side simulator with expo
* In the *utils/constants.js* file, assign EXPO_IP to the IP address that is shown in the terminal, this is where expo is running and the client socket needs to connect to.
* In another terminal, go to the *server* directory and run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`, this will start the server

If you did it correctly you should see an acknowledgement in the terminal that the client has connected to the server, with matching socket id's.
