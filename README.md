## Problem to Solve

The problem to solve is the struggle to satisfy everyone's musical preferences at events. The application aims to resolve this issue by allowing users to create and join rooms where everyone can contribute to the music selection. This ensures a democratic and inclusive environment where everyone's taste in music is taken into account, enhancing the overall experience.

## Target User Demographic

- Mainly teenagers to young adults. Anyone that is involved in party/group settings often
- People looking to find/listen to new music

## **Market Research and Trends**

### Competition:

- **Pandora**: A music streaming app that allows users to create their own stations based on their favorite genres, artists, or songs. While it provides a personalized experience, it doesn't allow for group collaboration or democratic song selection. It's mainly a personal listening experience.
    - Ranked highly in Music.
    - Millions of users.
    - Available on iOS and Android.
    - Free, with in-app purchases.
    - Limited to individual usage.
    - UI is simple and easy to use.
- **JQBX (Jukebox)**: Allows users to create rooms and play music synchronously with friends or public users. Songs are voted on by listeners, but the app relies on Spotify Premium and doesn't support other music platforms.
    - Limited user base.
    - Available on iOS, Android, and desktop.
    - Requires Spotify Premium.
    - Allows democratic song selection in group settings.
- **Aux**: A social music app that allows friends to add songs to a shared queue. However, it is limited by the requirement of Apple Music and does not allow users without it to participate fully.
    - Available on iOS.
    - Requires Apple Music.
    - Allows group song selection.

These examples show that there is a market for shared music experiences and a space for an app that democratically curates music at events. There is room for improvement, particularly in facilitating a cross-platform experience that includes users of different music streaming services.

## **Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**

What sets our application apart from existing solutions?

- **User Interface (UI) Optimization:** This is **essential** in differentiating ourselves from our competition; a user-centred design approach to our UI/UX keeps users on the app and coming back for more. Differentiating ourselves by providing a sleek and user-friendly interface, eliminating the drawbacks of janky logins and difficult navigation found in existing platforms.
- **Cross-Platform Availability:** Offering accessibility on both iOS and Android platforms, providing a seamless experience for a wider user base.
- **Can influence music selection with and without a Spotify Premium account**

By strategically addressing these aspects, our application aims to not only fill the existing gaps in the market but also surpass the limitations of current competitors.

## 1. Sign in through Spotify

Users will sign in using their Spotify account. This allows the app to access the user's Spotify music library for integration into the app.

### 2. Create a room

Users can create a "room" where they can invite others to join. The room serves as a shared space for everyone to contribute to the music selection.

### 3. Search and select tracks

Within the room, users can search for and select tracks from their Spotify library to add to the room's shared playlist.

### 4. Join a room

Users can also join existing rooms created by others. Once inside, they can participate in adding to and voting on the music selection.

## **Safety and Privacy Measures**

Assure users that their safety and privacy are top priorities. Detail the security features in place, such as account verification, data encryption, and any community guidelines that ensure a positive and respectful environment.

## **Social Media Integration**

Our app will enhance user engagement through social media integration. Users can easily share their activities, such as creating a new room or adding a favorite song, on popular platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. This not only promotes the app but also allows users to connect with friends and invite them to join the experience.

## **Community Building**

We aim to cultivate a robust community within the app. By launching user forums and discussion boards, we can facilitate dialogue about music trends, favorite songs, and event planning tips. We also plan to host virtual events, such as music listening parties or themed playlist creation contests, to boost user interaction and foster a sense of belonging.

## **Mobile Accessibility**

Our app will be accessible on both iOS and Android platforms to cater to a wider user base. In the future, we plan to expand our app to other devices such as tablets, and potentially develop a web version for desktop use.

## **Metrics and Success Indicators**

The success of our application will be measured by key performance indicators like user retention rates, the number of rooms created, and the frequency of song additions to rooms. We will also pay close attention to user feedback and ratings on app stores to identify areas of improvement and gauge user satisfaction.

## **Legal and Compliance**

Our app will adhere to Spotify's regulations as well. We'll be using Spotify's API in compliance with their terms of service, ensuring proper usage of user data, and respecting copyright laws. This includes not redistributing music or violating any usage rights associated with Spotify's service. By doing so, we not only maintain a legally compliant service but also contribute to a trustworthy and secure environment for all users.
